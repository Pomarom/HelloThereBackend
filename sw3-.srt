1
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,860
Lock onto him, R2.

2
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:12,400
Master, General Grievous's ship
is directly ahead...

3
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,730
the one crawling with vulture droids.

4
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,360
Oh, I see it.
Oh, this is going to be easy.

5
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,580
- Oddball, do you copy?
- " Copy, Red Leader. "

6
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,980
Mark my position.
Form your squad up behind me.

7
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,990
We're on your tail, General Kenobi.

8
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,990
Set S-foils in attack position.

9
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,930
This is where the fun begins.

10
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,070
Let them pass between us.

11
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:12,760
They're all over me. Get them off my... "

12
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,760
- I'm gonna go help them out.
- No. "

13
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,560
No, they are doing their job
so we can do ours. "

14
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,110
Missiles. Pull up.

15
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,080
- They overshot us.
- They're coming around.

16
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,290
All right, R4.

17
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,920
No, no, no, no... No, nothing too fancy.

18
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,930
Surge all power units, R2.
Stand by reverse thrusters.

19
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,270
We got 'em, R2.

20
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,650
Flying is for droids.

21
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,670
- I'm hit. Anakin?
- I see them. Buzz droids. "

22
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,270
R4, be careful. You have a...

23
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,310
Oh, dear.

24
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,320
They're shutting down all the controls.

25
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,450
- Move to the right
so I can get a clear shot at them.
- The mission. "

26
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,390
Get to the command ship.
Get the chancellor.
I'm running out of tricks here.

27
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,570
Oh! In the name of...

28
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:06,840
- Hold your fire! You're not helping here.
- I agree. Bad idea.

29
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,010
I can't see a thing. My cockpit's fogging.

30
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,190
They're all over me. Anakin!

31
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,930
- Move to the right.
- Hold on, Anakin.
You're gonna get us both killed.

32
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,400
Get out of here.
There's nothing more you can do.

33
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,660
I'm not leaving without you, Master.

34
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,510
Get him, R2.

35
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,950
Watch out.

36
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,890
R2, hit the buzz droid's center eye.

37
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,430
- Yeah, you got him!
- Great, R2.

38
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,640
The general's command ship is dead ahead.

39
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,800
Well, have you noticed
the shields are still up?

40
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,900
Sorry, Master.

41
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,550
Oh, I have a bad feeling about this.

42
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:40,000
" FarangSiam thanks you.
Have Fun! "

43
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,530
There they are. Get them.

44
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:57,080
R2, locate the chancellor.

45
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,160
The chancellor's signal
is coming from right there...

46
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,330
the observation platform
at the top of that spire.

47
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,370
I sense Count Dooku.

48
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:16,740
- I sense a trap.
- Next move?

49
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,440
Spring the trap.

50
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,710
R2, go back.
I need you to stay with the ship.

51
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,710
Here. Take this and wait for orders.

52
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,520
What's the situation, Captain?

53
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:47,570
Two Jedi have landed in
the main hangar bay. We're tracking them.

54
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:51,970
Just as Count Dooku predicted.

55
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,180
Destroyers.

56
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,260
Drop your weapons. I said drop 'em.

57
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,850
- Roger.
- Roger, roger.

58
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,150
Roger, roger.

59
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,700
Those are Jedi fighters all right.

60
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,330
- Did you press the stop button?
- No. Did you?

61
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,265
No.

62
00:09:28,296 --> 00:09:30,740
Well, there's more than
one way out of here.

63
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,610
We don't want to get out.

64
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,420
We want to get moving.
R2, activate elevator 31174.

65
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,720
- Come in, R2. "
- What that?

66
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,730
R2, do you copy? "

67
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,730
R2, activate the elevator number... "

68
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:47,060
31174. "

69
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,100
Get back to work. That nothin'.

70
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,140
Activate the elevator 31174. "

71
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,140
R2, we...

72
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,870
Always on the move.

73
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,880
R2, switch on the comlink. "

74
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,970
R2, can you hear me? "

75
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,550
R2?

76
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,920
Whoa!

77
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,110
R2! R2!

78
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,930
Stop. Stop.
R2, we need to be going up.

79
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,300
Hands up, Jedi.

80
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,600
R2, do you copy? "

81
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,660
R2, do you hear me?
R2, we need to be going up, not down.

82
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,520
Hey, you!

83
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,620
Now, that's better.

84
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,990
You stupid little astro droid.

85
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,190
Uh-oh.

86
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,100
Oh, it's you.

87
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,040
My eyes! My eyes!

88
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,610
- What was that all about?
- Well, R2 has been...

89
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:09,650
- Uh, no loose wire jokes.
- Did I say anything?

90
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,680
- He's trying.
- I didn't say anything.

91
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,220
- Chancellor.
- Are you all right?

92
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,920
Count Dooku.

93
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:01,400
- This time we will do it together.
- I was about to say that.

94
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,540
Get help. You're no match for him.
He's a Sith lord.

95
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,710
Chancellor Palpatine,
Sith lords are our speciality.

96
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,720
Your swords, please.

97
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,280
We don't want to make a mess of things
in front of the chancellor.

98
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,620
You won't get away this time, Dooku.

99
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,570
I've been looking forward to this.

100
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,870
My powers have doubled since
the last time we met, Count.

101
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,430
Good. Twice the pride, double the fall.

102
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,500
Get...

103
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,820
I sense great fear in you, Skywalker.

104
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:41,590
You have hate. You have anger.

105
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,600
But you don't use them.

106
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:07,020
Good, Anakin. Good.

107
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,120
Kill him.

108
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,190
Kill him now.

109
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,740
I shouldn't.

110
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,770
Do it.

111
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,650
You did well, Anakin.

112
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,690
He was too dangerous to be kept alive.

113
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,190
Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.

114
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,160
I shouldn't have done that.
It's not the Jedi way.

115
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:53,400
It is only natural. He cut off your arm,
and you wanted revenge.

116
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,530
It wasn't the first time, Anakin.

117
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,410
Remember what you told me
about your mother and the Sand People?

118
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:06,780
Now we must leave before
more security droids arrive.

119
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:14,180
Anakin, there's no time.

120
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:17,520
We must get off this ship
before it's too late.

121
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,620
- He seems to be all right.
- Leave him, or we'll never make it.

122
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,430
His fate will be the same as ours.

123
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:31,030
Prepare for attack!

124
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,240
All batteries, fire! Fire!

125
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,220
Elevator's not working.

126
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,620
R2, activate elevator 3224.

127
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:15,580
- Reverse stabilizers.
- Reversing stabilizers.

128
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,970
Magnetize! Magnetize!

129
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,880
Fire the emergency booster engines.

130
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,790
We're leveling out, sir.

131
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,390
Oh!

132
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,730
Easy. We're in a bit of a situation here.

133
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,470
- Did I miss something?
- Hold on.

134
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,740
- What is that?
- Uh, oops.

135
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,840
R2. R2, shut down the elevator.

136
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,880
Too late. Jump!

137
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,160
Let's see if we can find something
in the hangar bay that's still flyable.

138
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,330
R2, get down here.

139
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,700
R2, do you copy? "

140
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,370
General, we found the Jedi.

141
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,880
- They're in hallway 328.
- Activate ray shields.

142
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,190
Ray shields.

143
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,190
Wait a minute. How did this happen?

144
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,620
- We're smarter than this.
- Apparently not.

145
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,790
- I say patience.
- Patience?

146
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,200
Yes. R2 will be along in a few moments...

147
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,570
and then... he'll release the ray shields.

148
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,410
See? No problem.

149
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,650
Don't move.

150
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,580
Ow!

151
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,590
Do you have a plan "B"?

152
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:43,830
Ah, yes. The negotiator.

153
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:48,170
General Kenobi.
We've been waiting for you.

154
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,430
Excuse me.

155
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,300
- That wasn't much of a rescue.
- You're welcome.

156
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:55,840
And...

157
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:58,740
Anakin Skywalker.

158
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:04,550
I was expecting someone with
your reputation to be a little... older.

159
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:10,960
General Grievous.
You're shorter than I expected.

160
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:15,590
Jedi scum.

161
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,460
We have a job to do, Anakin.
Try not to upset him.

162
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:27,940
Your lightsabers will make
a fine addition to my collection.

163
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:31,710
Not this time.
And this time, you won't escape.

164
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,050
R2.

165
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,520
Crush them!

166
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,680
Make them suffer!

167
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,390
Come. Now!

168
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,660
- Stay at your stations!
- Whoa!

169
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,830
Get him! Get him!

170
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,180
Ow!

171
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,100
Run!

172
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:26,310
Don't bother with them.
Keep the ship in orbit.

173
00:20:26,341 --> 00:20:27,320
Yes, sir.

174
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,880
You lose, General Kenobi.

175
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,800
Get out of here! Run!

176
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,450
Time to abandon ship.

177
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,100
All the escape pods have been launched.

178
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,260
Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?

179
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:38,360
- You mean, do I know how to land
what's left of this thing?
- Well?

180
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,070
Well, under the circumstances, I'd say the
ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant.

181
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:45,010
Strap yourselves in.

182
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,980
Open all hatches.
Extend all flaps and drag fins.

183
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,870
We lost something.

184
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:09,440
Not to worry. We are still
flying half a ship.

185
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:16,700
Now we're really picking up speed.

186
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:27,150
Eight plus 60.

187
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:31,280
- We're in the atmosphere.
- Grab that. Keep us level.

188
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:47,570
Steady.

189
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,310
Easy, R2.

190
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,210
5000. Fire ships on
the left and the right.

191
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,020
- We'll take you in.
" - Copy that. "

192
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,230
- Landing strip, straight ahead.
- We're coming in too hot.

193
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,290
Another happy landing.

194
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,869
Are you coming, Master?

195
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,520
Oh, no. I'm not brave enough for politics.

196
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,500
I have to report to the council.

197
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,070
Besides, someone needs
to be the poster boy.

198
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:22,000
Hold on.
This whole operation was your idea.

199
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:25,200
Let us not forget, Anakin,
that you rescued me from the buzz droids.

200
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,780
And you killed Count Dooku,
and you rescued the chancellor...

201
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,780
carrying me unconscious on your back.

202
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,400
All because of your training.

203
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,010
Anakin, let's be fair.
Today you were the hero...

204
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,180
and you deserve your glorious day
with the politicians.

205
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:43,350
All right. But you owe me one, and not for
saving your skin for the 10th time.

206
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:47,690
Ninth time. That business on
Cato Neimoidia doesn't... doesn't count.

207
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,700
I'll see you at the briefing.

208
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,600
Chancellor Palpatine, are you all right?

209
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:00,610
Yes. Thanks to your two Jedi knights.

210
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:05,370
They killed Count Dooku, but
General Grievous has escaped once again.

211
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,010
General Grievous will run and hide,
as he always does. He's a coward.

212
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,420
But with Count Dooku dead,
he is the leader of the droid army.

213
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,243
And I assure you, the senate will vote...

214
00:25:16,274 --> 00:25:19,320
to continue the war as long
as Grievous is alive.

215
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,420
Then the Jedi Council will make
finding Grievous our highest priority.

216
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,840
- Watch it.
- Excuse me.

217
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,910
- Come along, R2.
- The Republic cannot praise you enough.

218
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,130
Thank you, Senator Organa.

219
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,800
Well, it couldn't possibly be
as bad as all that.

220
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,850
Now there I agree with you.

221
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:41,310
In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.

222
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:46,550
But the fighting will continue
until General Grievous is spare parts.

223
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:49,150
Well, I will do everything I can
in the senate.

224
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,520
- Excuse me.
- Certainly.

225
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,040
Oh, Anakin.

226
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,800
I've missed you, Padme.

227
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:13,240
There were whispers
that you'd been killed.

228
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,910
I'm all right.

229
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:19,010
It feels like we've been
apart for a lifetime.

230
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,920
And it might have been,
if the chancellor hadn't been kidnapped.

231
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:25,290
I don't think they would have ever
brought us back from the outer rim sieges.

232
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,130
- Wait. Not here.
- Yes, here.

233
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:31,720
I'm... I'm tired of all this deception.
I don't care if they know we're married.

234
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,100
Anakin, don't say things like that.

235
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:46,540
Are you all right? You're trembling.

236
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:48,740
What's going on?

237
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,790
Something wonderful has happened.

238
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:58,260
Ani, I'm pregnant.

239
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,170
That's...

240
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,860
Well, that's won... That's wonderful.

241
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:16,600
What are we gonna do?

242
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:21,520
We're not gonna worry
about anything right now. All right?

243
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:24,090
This is a happy moment.

244
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:28,390
The happiest moment of my life.

245
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:37,390
Yes, Lord Sidious?

246
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,390
" General Grievous... "

247
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:44,590
" I suggest you move
the separatist leaders to Mustafar. "

248
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,570
It will be done, my lord.

249
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:52,940
" The end of the war is near, General. "

250
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,670
But the loss of Count Dooku...

251
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:01,080
" His death was a necessary loss. "

252
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:05,310
" Soon I will have a new apprentice... "

253
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:10,690
" one far younger and more powerful. "

254
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,750
Ani, I want to have our baby
back home on Naboo.

255
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,190
We can go to the lake country
where no one will know...

256
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:46,190
where we can be safe.

257
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:50,730
I can go early and fix up the baby's room.

258
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:58,040
I know the perfect spot.
Right by the gardens.

259
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:05,610
You are so... beautiful.

260
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:09,280
It's only because I'm so in love.

261
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,820
No.

262
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,120
No, it's because I'm so in love with you.

263
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,750
So love has blinded you?

264
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,590
Well, that's not exactly what I meant.

265
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,230
But it's probably true.

266
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:37,370
Anakin, help me!

267
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,510
What's bothering you?

268
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,940
Nothing.

269
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:51,220
I remember when I gave this to you.

270
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:55,520
How long is it gonna take
for us to be honest with each other?

271
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:00,030
It was a dream.

272
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:02,260
Bad?

273
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:04,800
Like the ones I used to have
about my mother...

274
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,800
just before she died.

275
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,800
And?

276
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,610
And it was about you.

277
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,080
Tell me.

278
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,780
It was only a dream.

279
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:36,670
You die in childbirth.

280
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:39,560
And the baby?

281
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:42,000
I don't know.

282
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:45,410
It was only a dream.

283
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:48,310
I won't let this one become real.

284
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:52,040
This baby will change our lives.

285
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:55,080
I doubt the queen will continue
to allow me to serve in the senate.

286
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,910
And if the council discovers
you're the father, you'll be expelled...

287
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,510
I... I know. I know.

288
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:04,290
Do you think Obi-Wan
might be able to help us?

289
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:08,350
We don't need his help.

290
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,690
Our baby is a blessing.

291
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:33,050
Premonitions? Premonitions. Hmm.

292
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,320
These visions you have...

293
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:40,020
They're of pain, suffering.

294
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,860
Death.

295
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:48,340
Yourself you speak of,
or someone you know?

296
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,860
Someone.

297
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:53,870
Close to you?

298
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,270
Yes.

299
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:01,250
Careful you must be when
sensing the future, Anakin.

300
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:05,650
The fear of loss is a path
to the dark side.

301
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,190
I won't let these visions
come true, Master Yoda.

302
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:14,490
Death is a natural part of life.

303
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:19,260
Rejoice for those around you
who transform into the Force.

304
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:22,670
Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not.

305
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:25,870
Attachment leads to jealousy.

306
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,410
The shadow of greed that is.

307
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:32,350
What must I do, Master Yoda?

308
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:35,470
Train yourself to let go...

309
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:39,020
of everything you fear to lose.

310
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:52,160
You've missed the report
on the outer rim sieges.

311
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,000
I'm sorry. I was held up.

312
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:59,700
- I have no excuse.
- In short, they are going very well.

313
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:05,210
Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos
has moved his troops to Boz Pity.

314
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:07,310
What's wrong, then?

315
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:10,010
The senate is expected...

316
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,610
to vote more executive powers
to the chancellor today.

317
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:18,090
Well, that can only mean less deliberating
and more action. Is that bad?

318
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:20,590
It'll make it easier
for us to end this war.

319
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,660
Be careful of your friend Palpatine.

320
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,240
Be careful of what?

321
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,970
- He has requested your presence.
- What for?

322
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:35,700
- He would not say.
- He didn't inform the council?

323
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:39,270
- That's unusual, isn't it?
- All of this is unusual.

324
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,820
And it's making me feel uneasy.

325
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,700
I hope you trust me, Anakin.

326
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,930
Of course.

327
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,000
I need your help, son.

328
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,170
What do you mean?

329
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:12,480
- I'm depending on you.
- For what? I don't understand.

330
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:18,140
To be the eyes, ears
and voice of the Republic.

331
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,380
Anakin...

332
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:24,650
I'm appointing you to be my personal
representative on the Jedi Council.

333
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,030
Me? A master?

334
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,530
I'm overwhelmed, sir.

335
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,530
But the council elects its own members.
They'll never accept this.

336
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,130
I think they will. They need you.

337
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,640
More than you know.

338
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:58,160
Allow this appointment lightly
the council does not.

339
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:01,660
Disturbing is this move
by Chancellor Palpatine.

340
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,420
I understand.

341
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:09,600
You are on this council, but
we do not grant you the rank of master.

342
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,730
What?

343
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:20,210
How can you do this? This is outrageous.

344
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,440
It's unfair.

345
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:27,080
How can you be on the council
and not be a master?

346
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:30,680
Take a seat, young Skywalker.

347
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,030
Forgive me, Master.

348
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:42,070
" We have surveyed all systems
in the Republic... "

349
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:45,900
" but have found no sign
of General Grievous. "

350
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:48,770
Hiding in the outer rim Grievous is.

351
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,970
The outlying systems you must sweep.

352
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,310
We do not have many ships to spare.

353
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,610
" What about the droid attack
on the Wookiees? "

354
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,420
It is critical we send an attack group
there immediately.

355
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,920
He's right. It's a system
we cannot afford to lose.

356
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,390
Go I will.

357
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,490
Good relations with the Wookiees I have.

358
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,930
It's settled then.
Yoda will take a battalion of clones...

359
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,340
to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.

360
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,500
May the Force be with us all.

361
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,370
What kind of nonsense is this?

362
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,910
Put me on the council
and not make me a master?

363
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,710
It's never been done in
the history of the Jedi. It's insulting.

364
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,720
Oh, calm down, Anakin.
You have been given a great honor.

365
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:36,850
To be on the council at your age...
it's never happened before.

366
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,360
The fact of the matter is
you are too close to the chancellor.

367
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:44,260
The council doesn't like it
when he interferes in Jedi affairs.

368
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:50,070
- I swear to you, I didn't ask
to be put on the council.
- But it's what you wanted.

369
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:53,510
Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine
seems to have paid off.

370
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:55,510
That has nothing to do with this.

371
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:58,550
The only reason the council
has approved your appointment...

372
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:01,640
is because the chancellor trusts you.

373
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:04,780
- And?
- Anakin, I am on your side.

374
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:07,131
I didn't want to put
you in this situation.

375
00:39:07,162 --> 00:39:08,180
What situation?

376
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:16,600
The council wants you to report on
all the chancellor's dealings.

377
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,070
They want to know what he's up to.

378
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:26,470
They want me to spy on the chancellor?

379
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:29,200
- But that's treason.
- We are at war, Anakin.

380
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:34,180
Why didn't the council give me
this assignment when we were in session?

381
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,720
This assignment is not to be on record.

382
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:40,760
The chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan.

383
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,880
He befriended me.
He's watched out for me ever
since I arrived here.

384
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:46,090
That is why you must help us.

385
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,690
Anakin, our allegiance is to the senate,
not to its leader...

386
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,500
who has managed to stay in office
long after his term has expired.

387
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,570
The senate demanded that he stay longer.

388
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:58,830
Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin.
Something is out of place.

389
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:03,500
You're asking me to do something
against the Jedi code...

390
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:07,340
against the Republic,
against a mentor and a friend.

391
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:11,250
That's what's out of place here.
Why are you asking this of me?

392
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,460
The council is asking you.

393
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,200
Anakin did not take to his new assignment
with much enthusiasm.

394
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,470
It's very dangerous,
putting them together.

395
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:32,910
I don't think the boy can handle it.

396
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:35,500
I don't trust him.

397
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:39,480
With all due respect, Master,
is he not the chosen one?

398
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:43,280
Is he not to destroy the Sith
and bring balance to the Force?

399
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:46,250
So the prophecy says.

400
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:51,220
A prophecy that misread could have been.

401
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,960
He will not let me down.

402
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,000
He never has.

403
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:00,130
I hope right you are.

404
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:28,830
Sometimes I wonder
what's happening to the Jedi order.

405
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:31,960
I think this war is destroying
the principles of the Republic.

406
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,030
Have you ever considered
that we may be on the wrong side?

407
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,630
What do you mean?

408
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:44,340
What if the democracy we thought
we were serving no longer exists...

409
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:48,040
and the Republic has become the very evil
we've been fighting to destroy?

410
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:50,180
I don't believe that.

411
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:52,380
And you're sounding like a separatist.

412
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:57,330
This war represents a failure to listen.

413
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:59,450
Now you’re closer
to the chancellor than anyone.

414
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,830
Please, ask him to stop the fighting
and let diplomacy resume.

415
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:05,460
Don't ask me to do that.

416
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:10,700
Make a motion in the senate,
where that kind of a request belongs.

417
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:13,600
- What is it?
- Nothing.

418
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:18,780
Don't do this. Don't shut me out.
Let me help you.

419
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:23,220
Hold me.

420
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,450
Like you did by the lake on Naboo.

421
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,360
So long ago, when there was
nothing but our love.

422
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:33,900
No politics, no plotting, no war.

423
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:16,470
- You wanted to see me, Chancellor.
- Yes, Anakin. Come closer.

424
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:19,200
I have good news.

425
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:22,200
Our clone intelligence
units have discovered...

426
00:43:22,231 --> 00:43:24,670
the location of General Grievous.

427
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,650
He's hiding in the Utapau system.

428
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,650
At last.

429
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:33,250
We'll be able to capture
that monster and end this war.

430
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,720
I would worry about
the collective wisdom of the council...

431
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:39,230
if it didn't select you
for this assignment.

432
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:42,660
You're the best choice, by far.

433
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:47,090
Hmm. Sit down.

434
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,100
Leave us.

435
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,980
Anakin...

436
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:07,520
you know I'm not able
to rely on the Jedi Council.

437
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:13,490
If they haven't included you
in their plot, they soon will.

438
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,690
I'm not sure I understand.

439
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,500
You must sense
what I have come to suspect.

440
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,970
The Jedi Council want
control of the Republic.

441
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,860
They're planning to betray me.

442
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,380
- I don't think that...
- Anakin.

443
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:32,480
Search your feelings.

444
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,240
You know, don't you?

445
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:44,750
- I know they don't trust you.
- Hmm. Or the senate.

446
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:49,700
Or the Republic, or democracy,
for that matter.

447
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,830
I have to admit,
my trust in them has been shaken.

448
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:56,910
Why?

449
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:00,500
They asked you to do something...

450
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:02,870
that made you feel dishonest, didn't they?

451
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:08,750
They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?

452
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,790
I don't, uh...

453
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:17,830
I don't know what to say.

454
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:21,490
Remember back to your early teachings.

455
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,900
All who gain power are afraid to lose it.

456
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,670
- Even the Jedi.
- The Jedi use their power for good.

457
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:32,900
Good is a point of view,Anakin.

458
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:38,170
The Sith and the Jedi
are similar in almost every way...

459
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:42,980
including their quest for greater power.

460
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,550
The Sith rely on their passion
for their strength.

461
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:50,420
They think inwards...
only about themselves.

462
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:53,860
And the Jedi don't?

463
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:58,520
The Jedi are selfless.
They only care about others.

464
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:13,670
Did you ever hear the tragedy
of Darth Plagueis the Wise?

465
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,350
- No.
- I thought not.

466
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,860
It's not a story the Jedi would tell you.

467
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:26,660
It's a Sith legend.

468
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,660
Darth Plagueis...

469
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:34,430
was a dark lord of the Sith
so powerful and so wise...

470
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:39,370
he could use the Force to
influence the midi-chlorians...

471
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:42,670
to create... life.

472
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:47,370
He had such a knowledge
of the dark side...

473
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:52,510
he could even keep
the ones he cared about...

474
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:54,520
from dying.

475
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:02,660
He could actually...
save people from death?

476
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:08,030
The dark side of the Force is
a pathway to many abilities...

477
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:12,370
some consider to be unnatural.

478
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,340
Wh... What happened to him?

479
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,500
He became so powerful...

480
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:22,750
the only thing he was afraid of was...

481
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:24,750
losing his power.

482
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:28,310
Which eventually, of course, he did.

483
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:34,290
Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice
everything he knew.

484
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,060
Then his apprentice
killed him in his sleep.

485
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,100
It's ironic.

486
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,230
He could save others from death...

487
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:47,430
but not himself.

488
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:54,140
Is it possible to learn this power?

489
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:00,110
Not from a Jedi.

490
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:18,910
" All Red units, over here! "

491
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:33,780
" Palpatine thinks General Grievous
is on Utapau? "

492
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:36,950
A partial message was intercepted
in a diplomatic packet...

493
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:40,190
" - from the chairman of Utapau. "
- Hmm.

494
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:43,030
" Act on this we must. "

495
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:47,860
" The capture of General Grievous
will end this war. "

496
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:51,800
" Quickly and decisively we should proceed. "

497
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:56,940
The chancellor has requested...
that I lead the campaign.

498
00:48:57,050 --> 00:49:00,380
The council will make up
its own mind who is to go...

499
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,450
not the chancellor.

500
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:07,490
" A master is needed, with more experience. "

501
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:12,080
" I concur. Master Kenobi should go. "

502
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:14,560
" - I agree.
- Aye. "

503
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,560
" Aye. "

504
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:20,360
" Very well. Council adjourned. "

505
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:29,170
The droids have started up
their main power generators.

506
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:34,740
- Then now the time is, Commander.
- Yes, sir.

507
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,930
Charge!

508
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,780
Head for cover!

509
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,436
You're gonna need me on this one, Master.

510
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:24,350
Oh, I agree.

511
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:27,438
However, it may turn out just
to be a wild bantha chase.

512
00:50:27,469 --> 00:50:28,490
Master.

513
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:35,740
I've disappointed you. Uh, I haven't been
very appreciative of your training.

514
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:40,250
I've been arrogant, and I apologize.

515
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:42,710
I've just been so frustrated
with the council.

516
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:49,750
You are strong and wise, Anakin,
and I am very proud of you.

517
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:52,490
I have trained you since
you were a small boy.

518
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:54,690
I have taught you everything I know.

519
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,530
And you have become a far greater Jedi
than I could ever hope to be.

520
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:01,330
But be patient, Anakin.

521
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,370
It will not be long before the council
makes you a Jedi master.

522
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:16,050
Obi-Wan. May the Force be with you.

523
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:19,020
Good-bye, old friend.
May the Force be with you.

524
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:46,210
Fortunately, most of the cities are
concentrated on this small continent here.

525
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:50,380
- On the far side.
- I'll keep them distracted
until you get there.

526
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:53,890
- Just don't take too long.
- Come on. When have I ever let you down?

527
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:55,890
Very well.

528
00:51:55,990 --> 00:52:00,430
The burden is on me not to destroy
all the droids until you arrive.

529
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:27,990
Save your energy.

530
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:30,110
I can't.

531
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,990
Don't give up, Padme.

532
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:47,940
Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?

533
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,070
He came by this morning.

534
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,380
What did he want?

535
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,420
He's worried about you.

536
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,860
He says you've been under a lot of stress.

537
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,720
I feel lost.

538
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:08,990
Lost? What do you mean?

539
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:13,300
Obi-Wan and the council don't trust me.

540
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,800
They trust you with their lives.

541
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,630
Something's happening.

542
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:23,370
I'm not the Jedi I should be.

543
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:27,650
I want more.

544
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,780
And I know I shouldn't.

545
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,890
You expect too much of yourself.

546
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:42,060
- I found a way to save you.
- Save me?

547
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,100
From my nightmares.

548
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,130
Is that what's bothering you?

549
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:49,830
I won't lose you, Padme.

550
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:52,030
I'm not gonna die in childbirth, Ani.

551
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:54,540
- I promise you.
- No, I promise you.

552
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,920
Greetings, young Jedi.

553
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:44,460
What brings you to our remote sanctuary?

554
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,490
Unfortunately, the war.

555
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:51,160
There's no war here...
unless you brought it with you.

556
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:54,460
With your kind permission,
I should like some fuel...

557
00:54:54,570 --> 00:55:00,410
and to use your city as a base as I search
nearby systems for General Grievous.

558
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:11,780
He is here. We are being held hostage.

559
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:14,790
- They are watching us.
- I understand.

560
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:19,690
Tenth level, thousands of battle droids.

561
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:22,260
Tell your people to take shelter.

562
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:25,330
If you have warriors, now is the time.

563
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:40,440
Take the fighter back to the ship.
Tell Cody I've made contact.

564
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:46,480
- Is he bringing additional warriors?
- He didn't say.

565
00:56:28,830 --> 00:56:34,060
It won't be long before the armies
of the Republic track us here.

566
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:41,870
I am sending you to the Mustafar system
in the outer rim.

567
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:51,720
It is a volcanic planet.

568
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:55,120
- You will be safe there.
- Safe?

569
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:59,220
Humph! Chancellor Palpatine
managed to escape your grip, General.

570
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:03,760
Without Count Dooku, I have doubts
about your ability to keep us safe.

571
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:06,800
Be thankful, Viceroy...

572
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:09,800
you have not found yourself in my grip.

573
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:16,770
Your ship is waiting.

574
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:35,060
Hello there.

575
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:42,300
General Kenobi.

576
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,930
You are a bold one.

577
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,440
Kill him.

578
00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:06,420
Back away.

579
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:10,460
I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.

580
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,760
Your move.

581
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:14,770
You fool.

582
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:20,470
I've been trained in your
Jedi arts by Count Dooku.

583
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:29,480
Attack, Kenobi.

584
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:48,190
Army or not...

585
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:53,390
you must realize you are doomed.

586
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,470
Oh, I don't think so.

587
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:27,160
Uh-oh.

588
01:00:32,310 --> 01:00:34,270
Hyah!

589
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:55,220
" Cover that corner. "

590
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:03,760
" Master Windu, may I interrupt? "

591
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:06,640
" General Kenobi has made contact
with General Grievous... "

592
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:09,010
" and we have begun our attack. "

593
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:11,510
Thank you, Commander.

594
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:14,780
Anakin, deliver this report
to the chancellor.

595
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:17,440
His reaction will give us
a clue to his intentions.

596
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:19,650
Yes, Master.

597
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:29,730
I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi.

598
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:32,460
The dark side of the Force
surrounds the chancellor.

599
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:34,811
" If he does not give up
his emergency powers... "

600
01:01:34,842 --> 01:01:36,930
" after the destruction of Grievous... "

601
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,560
" then he should be removed from office. "

602
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:43,340
The Jedi Council would have to
take control of the senate...

603
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,570
in order to secure a peaceful transition.

604
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:50,140
" To a dark place this line
of thought will carry us. "

605
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:55,880
" Hmm. Great care we must take. "

606
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:04,090
Chancellor.

607
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,720
We've just received a report
from Master Kenobi.

608
01:02:06,830 --> 01:02:09,500
He has engaged General Grievous.

609
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,940
We can only hope that Master Kenobi
is up to the challenge.

610
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,770
I should be there with him.

611
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:19,240
It's upsetting to me
to see that the council...

612
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:22,610
doesn't seem to fully appreciate
your talents.

613
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:26,810
Don't you wonder
why they won't make you a Jedi master?

614
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:30,480
I wish I knew.

615
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:34,310
More and more I get the feeling that...

616
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:36,650
I'm being excluded from the council.

617
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:47,570
I know there are things about the Force
that they're not telling me.

618
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:52,240
They don't trust you, Anakin.

619
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:55,000
They see your future.

620
01:02:55,110 --> 01:03:00,070
They know your power
will be too strong to control.

621
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:05,920
You must break through the fog of lies
the Jedi have created around you.

622
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:11,380
Let me help you to know
the subtleties of the Force.

623
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:14,260
How do you know the ways of the Force?

624
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:19,030
My mentor taught me
everything about the Force.

625
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:22,100
Even the nature of the dark side.

626
01:03:24,110 --> 01:03:26,440
You know the dark side?

627
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:28,970
Anakin...

628
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:32,380
if one is to understand
the great mystery...

629
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:35,040
one must study all its aspects...

630
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:38,120
not just the dogmatic
narrow view of the Jedi.

631
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:42,020
If you wish to become
a complete and wise leader...

632
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:45,790
you must embrace a larger view
of the Force.

633
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:48,490
Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin.

634
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,790
Only through me...

635
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:54,770
can you achieve a power
greater than any Jedi.

636
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:58,170
Learn to know the dark side
of the Force...

637
01:03:58,270 --> 01:04:01,940
and you will be able to save your wife...

638
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:04,070
from certain death.

639
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:07,110
What did you say?

640
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:10,840
Use my knowledge. I beg you.

641
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:14,710
You're the Sith lord.

642
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:18,690
I know what's been troubling you.
Listen to me.

643
01:04:18,790 --> 01:04:23,350
Don't continue to be a pawn
of the Jedi Council.

644
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:28,960
Ever since I've known you,
you've been searching for a life...

645
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:31,630
greater than that of an ordinary Jedi.

646
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:34,110
A life of significance...

647
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:36,570
of conscience.

648
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:44,980
- Are you going to kill me?
- I would certainly like to.

649
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:48,490
I know you would.

650
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:52,390
I can feel your anger.

651
01:04:52,490 --> 01:04:55,190
It gives you focus...

652
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:57,630
makes you stronger.

653
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:08,030
- I'm going to turn you
over to the Jedi Council.
- Of course. You should.

654
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:11,170
But you're not sure
of their intentions, are you?

655
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:14,810
I will quickly discover
the truth of all this.

656
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:17,350
You have great wisdom, Anakin.

657
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:21,080
Know the power of the dark side.

658
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:23,950
Power to save Padme.

659
01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:56,210
Aah!

660
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:33,650
So uncivilized.

661
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:43,190
Master Windu, I must talk to you.

662
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:47,360
Skywalker, we just received word that
Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous.

663
01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:49,686
We're on our way to make
sure the chancellor returns...

664
01:07:49,717 --> 01:07:51,430
emergency power back to the senate.

665
01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:55,240
He won't give up his power.
I've just learned a terrible truth.

666
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:58,440
I think Chancellor Palpatine
is a Sith lord.

667
01:07:58,550 --> 01:08:00,510
A Sith lord?

668
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:03,450
Yes. The one we've been looking for.

669
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:07,510
- How do you know this?
- He knows the ways of the Force.

670
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:09,750
He's been trained to use the dark side.

671
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:12,660
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

672
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:16,360
Then our worst fears have been realized.

673
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:19,920
We must move quickly
if the Jedi order is to survive.

674
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:22,470
Master, the chancellor is very powerful.

675
01:08:22,570 --> 01:08:24,870
You'll need my help
if you're going to arrest him.

676
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:27,910
For you own good, stay out of this affair.

677
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:30,770
I sense a great deal of confusion in you,
young Skywalker.

678
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,040
There is much fear that
clouds your judgment.

679
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:35,310
- I must go, Master.
- No.

680
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:39,290
If what you've told me is true...

681
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:41,290
you will have gained my trust.

682
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:43,910
But for now, remain here.

683
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,960
Wait in the council chambers
until we return.

684
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:51,490
Yes, Master.

685
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:23,860
" You do know, don't you... "

686
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,330
" if the Jedi destroy me... "

687
01:09:26,430 --> 01:09:30,390
" any chance of saving her will be lost. "

688
01:10:59,330 --> 01:11:03,760
Master Windu. I take it General Grievous
has been destroyed then.

689
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:07,130
I must say you're here
sooner than expected.

690
01:11:07,230 --> 01:11:10,860
In the name of
the Galactic Senate of the Republic...

691
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:12,910
you're under arrest, Chancellor.

692
01:11:13,010 --> 01:11:15,600
Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?

693
01:11:15,710 --> 01:11:17,640
The senate will decide your fate.

694
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:21,580
- I am the senate.
- Not yet.

695
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:29,250
It's treason then.

696
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:11,790
You are under arrest, my lord.

697
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:15,490
Anakin, I told you it would come to this.

698
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,220
I was right.

699
01:13:17,330 --> 01:13:19,490
The Jedi are taking over.

700
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,070
The oppression of the Sith
will never return.

701
01:13:22,170 --> 01:13:24,400
You have lost.

702
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:26,470
No.

703
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:30,170
No. No. You will die!

704
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:34,840
He's a traitor!

705
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:38,210
He is the traitor!

706
01:13:39,950 --> 01:13:44,450
I have the power to save the one you love.

707
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:47,360
You must choose.

708
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:51,020
Don't listen to him, Anakin!

709
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:54,730
Don't let him kill me.

710
01:13:57,870 --> 01:14:00,570
I can't hold it any longer.

711
01:14:00,670 --> 01:14:04,040
I... I... I... I can't.
I... I... I'm weak.

712
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:06,110
I'm... I'm too weak.

713
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:07,650
Anakin.

714
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:10,220
Help me. Help me!

715
01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:16,910
I... I... I can't hold on any longer.

716
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:20,150
I am going to end this once and for all.

717
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:22,230
You can't.

718
01:14:22,330 --> 01:14:24,260
He must stand trial.

719
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:27,770
He has control of
the senate and the courts.

720
01:14:27,870 --> 01:14:30,100
He's too dangerous to be left alive.

721
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:34,160
I'm too weak. Oh. Don't kill me. Please.

722
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:36,170
It's not the Jedi way.

723
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:37,800
He must live.

724
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,070
Please don't.

725
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:44,410
I need him.

726
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,750
- Please don't!
- No!

727
01:14:52,990 --> 01:14:55,520
Power!

728
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:05,870
Unlimited power!

729
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:19,050
What have I done?

730
01:15:27,330 --> 01:15:32,360
You're fulfilling your destiny, Anakin.

731
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:35,200
Become my apprentice.

732
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:40,740
Learn to use the dark side of the Force.

733
01:15:43,410 --> 01:15:46,380
I will do whatever you ask.

734
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:50,980
Good.

735
01:15:52,690 --> 01:15:55,280
Just help me save Padme's life.

736
01:15:57,260 --> 01:15:59,620
I can't live without her.

737
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:07,200
To cheat death is a power
only one has achieved...

738
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:11,500
but if we work together...

739
01:16:11,610 --> 01:16:15,410
I know we can discover the secret.

740
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:19,140
I pledge myself...

741
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:23,570
to your teachings.

742
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:25,710
Good.

743
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:28,380
Good.

744
01:16:36,660 --> 01:16:41,100
The Force is strong with you.

745
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:46,760
A powerful Sith you will become.

746
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:51,140
Henceforth you shall be known as...

747
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:53,870
Darth...

748
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:55,950
Vader.

749
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:03,110
Thank you, my master.

750
01:17:05,330 --> 01:17:07,290
Rise.

751
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:25,380
Because the council did not trust you,
my young apprentice...

752
01:17:26,950 --> 01:17:31,710
I believe you are the only Jedi
with no knowledge of this plot.

753
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:35,780
When the Jedi learn
what has transpired here...

754
01:17:35,890 --> 01:17:37,860
they will kill us...

755
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:40,590
along with all the senators.

756
01:17:40,690 --> 01:17:42,660
I agree.

757
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:46,360
The council's next move
will be against the senate.

758
01:17:46,470 --> 01:17:49,460
Every single Jedi...

759
01:17:49,570 --> 01:17:52,830
including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi...

760
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:56,500
is now an enemy of the Republic.

761
01:17:57,540 --> 01:17:59,510
I understand, Master.

762
01:17:59,610 --> 01:18:02,210
We must move quickly.

763
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:04,280
The Jedi are relentless.

764
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:10,190
If they are not all destroyed,
it will be civil war without end.

765
01:18:11,890 --> 01:18:15,660
First I want you to go to the Jedi temple.

766
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:19,870
We will catch them off-balance.

767
01:18:19,870 --> 01:18:23,830
Do what must be done, Lord Vader.

768
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:27,930
Do not hesitate. Show no mercy.

769
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:32,810
Only then will you be strong enough
with the dark side...

770
01:18:32,910 --> 01:18:35,940
to save Padme.

771
01:18:36,050 --> 01:18:39,920
What about the other Jedi
spread across the galaxy?

772
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:43,080
Their betrayal will be dealt with.

773
01:18:44,990 --> 01:18:48,290
After you have killed all the Jedi
in the temple...

774
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:51,090
go to the Mustafar system.

775
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:54,460
Wipe out Viceroy Gunray...

776
01:18:54,570 --> 01:18:58,000
and the other separatist leaders.

777
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:04,010
Once more the Sith will rule the galaxy!

778
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:07,150
And...

779
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:12,010
we shall have... peace.

780
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:58,190
Sergeant, over here!

781
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:00,230
Hurry! Follow them!

782
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:04,900
" All Red units, let's move it! "

783
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,900
Come on. Let's go!

784
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:22,780
Commander, contact your troops.

785
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:24,860
Tell them to move to the higher levels.

786
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,860
Very good, sir.

787
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:29,090
Oh, by the way,
I think you'll be needing this.

788
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:32,760
Thank you, Cody. Now let's get a move on.
We've got a battle to win here.

789
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:34,770
- Hyah!
- Yes, sir.

790
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:43,600
" Commander Cody... "

791
01:20:43,710 --> 01:20:47,040
the time has come.

792
01:20:47,150 --> 01:20:51,380
Execute order 66.

793
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:53,450
Yes, my lord.

794
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:00,450
Blast him!

795
01:21:25,390 --> 01:21:27,650
Come on!

796
01:22:17,740 --> 01:22:22,230
" Execute order 66. "

797
01:22:22,340 --> 01:22:24,470
It will be done, my lord.

798
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:09,080
It will be done, my lord.

799
01:23:45,630 --> 01:23:48,060
Master Skywalker,
there are too many of them.

800
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:50,130
What are we going to do?

801
01:24:00,610 --> 01:24:04,770
The chancellor's office indicated
Master Anakin returned to the Jedi temple.

802
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:07,940
Don't worry. I...
I'm sure he'll be all right.

803
01:24:37,210 --> 01:24:40,270
- What's going on here?
- There's been a rebellion, sir.

804
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:42,940
Don't worry.
The situation is under control.

805
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:46,280
I'm sorry, sir.
It's time for you to leave.

806
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:49,990
And so it is.

807
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:56,290
Get him!

808
01:25:06,970 --> 01:25:08,840
No!

809
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:15,000
Don't worry about him. Let him go.

810
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:44,880
All these Wookiees are dead.
Move to the east.

811
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:46,950
Yes, sir.

812
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:56,450
Good-bye, Tarfful.

813
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:58,520
Good-bye, Chewbacca.

814
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:03,260
Miss you I will.

815
01:26:40,270 --> 01:26:42,560
Hopefully we'll be able to
intercept a few Jedi...

816
01:26:42,670 --> 01:26:45,030
before they walk into this catastrophe.

817
01:26:50,710 --> 01:26:52,640
Did you find Kenobi?

818
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:54,740
Sir, no one could have survived that fall.

819
01:26:54,850 --> 01:26:58,150
Start loading your men on the ships.

820
01:26:58,250 --> 01:27:01,020
Move it.

821
01:27:33,050 --> 01:27:35,040
Emergency code 91 3.

822
01:27:35,150 --> 01:27:37,050
I have no contact on any frequency.

823
01:27:39,130 --> 01:27:41,220
Master Kenobi.

824
01:27:41,330 --> 01:27:43,320
- Repeat.
" - Master Kenobi. "

825
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:47,330
Senator Organa.
My clone troops turned on me. I need help.

826
01:27:47,430 --> 01:27:50,030
" We have just rescued
Master Yoda. "

827
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:52,470
" It appears this ambush
has happened everywhere. "

828
01:27:52,570 --> 01:27:54,700
" We're sending you our coordinates. "

829
01:28:01,410 --> 01:28:04,350
Hush! Not so loud.

830
01:28:04,450 --> 01:28:07,480
Are you all right? I heard there was
an attack on the Jedi temple.

831
01:28:07,590 --> 01:28:10,060
- You could see the smoke from here.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

832
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:12,507
I came to see if you
and the baby are safe.

833
01:28:12,538 --> 01:28:13,710
What's happening?

834
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:16,660
The Jedi have tried to
overthrow the Republic.

835
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:19,320
I can't believe that.

836
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:23,990
I saw Master Windu attempt
to assassinate the chancellor myself.

837
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:27,560
Oh, Anakin. What are you gonna do?

838
01:28:36,250 --> 01:28:38,440
I will not betray the Republic.

839
01:28:40,450 --> 01:28:43,420
My loyalties lie with the chancellor...

840
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:46,250
and with the senate and with you.

841
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:48,550
What about Obi-Wan?

842
01:28:48,660 --> 01:28:50,890
I don't know.

843
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,090
Many Jedi have been killed.

844
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:57,000
We can only hope that
he's remained loyal to the chancellor.

845
01:28:57,100 --> 01:28:59,470
Anakin, I'm afraid.

846
01:29:01,410 --> 01:29:04,540
Have faith, my love.

847
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:06,940
Everything will soon be set right.

848
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:10,450
The chancellor has given me
a very important mission.

849
01:29:10,550 --> 01:29:13,750
The separatists have gathered
on the Mustafar system.

850
01:29:13,850 --> 01:29:16,380
I'm going there to end this war.

851
01:29:16,490 --> 01:29:18,390
Wait for me until I return.

852
01:29:18,490 --> 01:29:20,860
Things will be different. I promise.

853
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:28,670
Please, wait for me.

854
01:29:32,740 --> 01:29:35,470
Well, he is under a lot of stress, R2.

855
01:29:37,710 --> 01:29:39,610
Take care, my little friend.

856
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:47,610
Oh, my lady, is there anything I might do?

857
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:50,250
No, thank you, 3PO.

858
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:55,060
Oh. I... I feel so helpless.

859
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:21,250
How many other Jedi
have managed to survive?

860
01:30:21,350 --> 01:30:24,690
Heard from no one have we.

861
01:30:24,790 --> 01:30:27,880
I saw thousands of troops
attack the Jedi temple.

862
01:30:27,990 --> 01:30:29,890
That's why I went looking for Yoda.

863
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,560
Have we had any contact from the temple?

864
01:30:32,670 --> 01:30:35,530
Received a coded retreat message we have.

865
01:30:35,630 --> 01:30:39,660
It requests all Jedi
to return to the temple.

866
01:30:39,770 --> 01:30:43,210
- It says the war is over.
- Well, then we must go back.

867
01:30:43,310 --> 01:30:44,624
If there are any stragglers,

868
01:30:44,655 --> 01:30:46,830
they will fall into the trap
and be killed.

869
01:30:46,910 --> 01:30:51,750
Hmm. Suggest dismantling
the coded signal, do you?

870
01:30:51,850 --> 01:30:54,580
Yes, Master. There is too much at stake.

871
01:30:54,690 --> 01:30:57,250
I agree.

872
01:30:57,360 --> 01:31:00,950
And a little more knowledge
might light our way.

873
01:31:21,950 --> 01:31:25,380
The plan has gone
as you had promised, my lord.

874
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:28,250
" You have done well, Viceroy. "

875
01:31:28,350 --> 01:31:34,190
" When my new apprentice
Darth Vader arrives... "

876
01:31:34,290 --> 01:31:37,790
" he will take care of you. "

877
01:31:49,410 --> 01:31:52,540
We're receiving a message from
the chancellor's office, sir.

878
01:31:52,650 --> 01:31:54,610
- Send it through.
- Yes, sir.

879
01:31:56,350 --> 01:32:01,050
" Senator Organa, the supreme chancellor
requests your presence... "

880
01:32:01,150 --> 01:32:03,120
" at a special session of Congress. "

881
01:32:03,220 --> 01:32:06,750
- I will be there.
" - He'll be expecting you. "

882
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:13,060
- Could be a trap.
- I don't think so.

883
01:32:13,170 --> 01:32:16,260
The chancellor will not be able to control
the thousands of star systems...

884
01:32:16,370 --> 01:32:18,270
without keeping the senate intact.

885
01:32:18,370 --> 01:32:22,430
If a special session
of Congress there is...

886
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:25,840
easier for us to enter
the Jedi temple it will be.

887
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:06,280
R2, stay with the ship.

888
01:33:31,010 --> 01:33:34,740
Welcome, Lord Vader.
We've been expecting you.

889
01:34:06,610 --> 01:34:11,110
And the Jedi rebellion has been foiled.

890
01:34:11,220 --> 01:34:13,510
- What's happened?
- The chancellor's been elaborating...

891
01:34:13,620 --> 01:34:16,920
on a plot by the Jedi
to overthrow the senate.

892
01:34:17,020 --> 01:34:22,480
The remaining Jedi will be
hunted down and defeated.

893
01:34:38,310 --> 01:34:40,740
Not even the younglings survived.

894
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:43,810
Killed not by clones...

895
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:47,150
this Padawan.

896
01:34:48,250 --> 01:34:50,880
By a lightsaber he was.

897
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:01,320
Who? Who could have done this?

898
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:15,240
The attempt on my life...

899
01:35:15,350 --> 01:35:17,980
has left me scarred...

900
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:21,080
and deformed.

901
01:35:21,190 --> 01:35:24,090
But I assure you.

902
01:35:24,190 --> 01:35:28,890
My resolve has never been stronger!

903
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:36,970
Stop! No!

904
01:35:46,610 --> 01:35:50,280
In order to ensure the security...

905
01:35:50,380 --> 01:35:52,940
and continuing stability...

906
01:35:53,050 --> 01:35:56,950
the Republic will be reorganized...

907
01:35:57,060 --> 01:36:02,490
into the first Galactic Empire!

908
01:36:02,590 --> 01:36:04,620
For a safe...

909
01:36:04,730 --> 01:36:09,260
and secure society.

910
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:21,370
So this is how liberty dies.

911
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:24,180
With thunderous applause.

912
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:28,810
The war is over.

913
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:33,020
Lord Sidious promised us peace.
We only want...

914
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:45,870
I have recalibrated the code,
warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.

915
01:36:45,970 --> 01:36:48,410
For the clones...

916
01:36:48,510 --> 01:36:52,600
to discover the recalibration
a long time it will take.

917
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:07,020
Wait. Master.

918
01:37:07,130 --> 01:37:10,290
There is something I must know.

919
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,870
If into the security recordings you go...

920
01:37:18,970 --> 01:37:20,870
only pain will you find.

921
01:37:20,970 --> 01:37:24,410
I must know the truth, Master.

922
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:33,250
It can't be.

923
01:37:33,350 --> 01:37:35,250
It can't be.

924
01:37:35,350 --> 01:37:39,420
" You have done well, my new apprentice. "

925
01:37:39,530 --> 01:37:42,520
" Now, Lord Vader... "

926
01:37:42,630 --> 01:37:46,160
" go and bring peace to the Empire. "

927
01:37:46,270 --> 01:37:48,430
I can't watch any more.

928
01:37:48,530 --> 01:37:53,100
Destroy the Sith we must.

929
01:37:54,910 --> 01:37:57,000
Send me to kill the emperor.

930
01:37:57,110 --> 01:37:59,410
I will not kill Anakin.

931
01:37:59,510 --> 01:38:04,240
To fight this Lord Sidious,
strong enough you are not.

932
01:38:04,350 --> 01:38:07,580
He is like my brother. I cannot do it.

933
01:38:07,690 --> 01:38:13,420
Twisted by the dark side
young Skywalker has become.

934
01:38:13,530 --> 01:38:16,930
The boy you trained, gone he is.

935
01:38:17,030 --> 01:38:19,930
Consumed by Darth Vader.

936
01:38:20,030 --> 01:38:23,020
I do not know where
the emperor has sent him.

937
01:38:23,140 --> 01:38:25,370
I don't know where to look.

938
01:38:26,670 --> 01:38:30,370
Use your feelings, Obi-Wan,
and find him you will.

939
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:43,510
When was the last time you saw him?

940
01:38:43,620 --> 01:38:46,990
- Yesterday.
- And do you know where he is now?

941
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:50,060
No.

942
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:53,760
Padme, I need your help.

943
01:38:53,870 --> 01:38:56,860
- He is in grave danger.
- From the Sith?

944
01:38:56,970 --> 01:38:58,940
From himself.

945
01:39:01,370 --> 01:39:03,470
Padme...

946
01:39:03,580 --> 01:39:05,980
Anakin has turned to the dark side.

947
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:09,510
You're wrong. How could you even say that?

948
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:16,150
I have seen a... a security hologram...

949
01:39:16,260 --> 01:39:18,690
of him...

950
01:39:18,790 --> 01:39:20,690
killing younglings.

951
01:39:20,790 --> 01:39:23,820
Not Anakin. He couldn't.

952
01:39:23,930 --> 01:39:26,900
He was deceived by a lie. We all were.

953
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:31,490
It appears that the chancellor
is behind everything, including the war.

954
01:39:33,340 --> 01:39:36,070
Palpatine is the Sith lord
we've been looking for.

955
01:39:36,170 --> 01:39:40,270
After the death of Count Dooku,
Anakin became his new apprentice.

956
01:39:46,490 --> 01:39:48,450
I don't believe you.

957
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:51,820
I can't.

958
01:39:56,930 --> 01:39:59,420
Padme...

959
01:39:59,530 --> 01:40:01,800
I must find him.

960
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:06,270
You're going to kill him, aren't you?

961
01:40:09,940 --> 01:40:12,430
He has become a very great threat.

962
01:40:15,050 --> 01:40:17,020
I can't.

963
01:40:30,230 --> 01:40:32,160
Anakin is the father, isn't he?

964
01:40:35,970 --> 01:40:38,800
I'm so sorry.

965
01:41:24,350 --> 01:41:26,010
Milady, let me come with you.

966
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:28,880
There's no danger. The fighting's over.
And this is personal.

967
01:41:28,990 --> 01:41:31,390
As you wish, milady,
but I strongly disagree.

968
01:41:31,490 --> 01:41:35,150
I'll be all right, Captain.
This is something I must do myself.

969
01:41:35,260 --> 01:41:37,630
Besides, 3PO will look after me.

970
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:41,470
Oh, dear.

971
01:41:52,110 --> 01:41:54,200
Do you know?

972
01:41:54,310 --> 01:41:57,910
I think I'm beginning to get
the hang of this flying business. Hmm.

973
01:42:25,310 --> 01:42:28,750
" The separatists have been
taken care of, my master. "

974
01:42:28,850 --> 01:42:31,750
It is finished then.

975
01:42:33,150 --> 01:42:38,950
You have restored
peace and justice to the galaxy.

976
01:42:39,060 --> 01:42:43,960
" Send a message to the ships
of the Trade Federation. "

977
01:42:44,060 --> 01:42:49,230
" All droid units
must shut down immediately. "

978
01:42:49,330 --> 01:42:51,390
Very good, my lord.

979
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:53,420
I saw your ship.

980
01:43:56,270 --> 01:43:59,260
- What are you doing out here?
- I was so worried about you.

981
01:44:00,740 --> 01:44:03,610
Obi-Wan told me terrible things.

982
01:44:03,710 --> 01:44:05,840
What things?

983
01:44:05,940 --> 01:44:08,880
He said you've turned to the dark side.

984
01:44:08,980 --> 01:44:11,380
That you...

985
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:13,610
killed younglings.

986
01:44:15,150 --> 01:44:17,850
Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.

987
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:21,720
- He cares about us.
- Us?

988
01:44:21,830 --> 01:44:24,560
He knows.

989
01:44:24,660 --> 01:44:26,560
He wants to help you.

990
01:44:29,670 --> 01:44:33,660
Anakin, all I want is your love.

991
01:44:33,770 --> 01:44:36,100
Love won't save you, Padme.

992
01:44:36,210 --> 01:44:39,470
- Only my new powers can do that.
- At what cost?

993
01:44:39,580 --> 01:44:41,980
You're a good person. Don't do this.

994
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:44,810
I won't lose you the way I lost my mother.

995
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:49,150
I am becoming more powerful
than any Jedi has ever dreamed of.

996
01:44:49,250 --> 01:44:52,050
And I'm doing it for you. To protect you.

997
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:55,330
Come away with me.

998
01:44:55,430 --> 01:44:58,090
Help me raise our child.

999
01:44:58,200 --> 01:45:01,248
Leave everything else
behind while we still can.

1000
01:45:01,279 --> 01:45:02,460
Don't you see?

1001
01:45:02,530 --> 01:45:05,770
We don't have to run away anymore.

1002
01:45:05,870 --> 01:45:08,400
I have brought peace to the Republic.

1003
01:45:08,510 --> 01:45:11,370
I am more powerful than the chancellor.

1004
01:45:11,480 --> 01:45:13,570
I... I can overthrow him.

1005
01:45:15,650 --> 01:45:18,710
And together, you and I
can rule the galaxy...

1006
01:45:18,820 --> 01:45:21,220
make things the way we want them to be.

1007
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:29,550
I don't believe what I'm hearing.

1008
01:45:31,060 --> 01:45:34,360
Obi-Wan was right. You've changed.

1009
01:45:36,570 --> 01:45:39,440
I don't want to hear
any more about Obi-Wan.

1010
01:45:39,540 --> 01:45:43,700
The Jedi turned against me.
Don't you turn against me.

1011
01:45:45,410 --> 01:45:47,400
I don't know you anymore.

1012
01:45:49,050 --> 01:45:51,020
Anakin...

1013
01:45:51,120 --> 01:45:53,710
you're breaking my heart.

1014
01:45:53,820 --> 01:45:56,790
You're going down a path I can't follow.

1015
01:45:56,890 --> 01:45:59,650
Because of Obi-Wan?

1016
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:02,560
Because of what you've done.

1017
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:04,560
What you plan to do.

1018
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:08,460
Stop. Stop now. Come back.

1019
01:46:08,570 --> 01:46:11,500
- I love you.
- Liar!

1020
01:46:14,370 --> 01:46:16,240
No.

1021
01:46:16,340 --> 01:46:20,070
You're with him!
You brought him here to kill me.

1022
01:46:20,180 --> 01:46:23,110
- No.
- Let her go, Anakin.

1023
01:46:24,680 --> 01:46:26,240
Anakin.

1024
01:46:26,350 --> 01:46:28,510
Let her go.

1025
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:40,520
You turned her against me!

1026
01:46:42,130 --> 01:46:44,330
You have done that yourself.

1027
01:46:49,070 --> 01:46:51,270
You will not take her from me!

1028
01:46:51,380 --> 01:46:55,210
Your anger and your lust for power
have already done that.

1029
01:46:58,380 --> 01:47:03,510
You have allowed this dark lord
to twist your mind, until now-

1030
01:47:05,090 --> 01:47:08,250
until now you have become
the very thing you swore to destroy.

1031
01:47:08,360 --> 01:47:10,290
Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan.

1032
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:12,890
I see through the lies of the Jedi.

1033
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,400
I do not fear the dark side as you do.

1034
01:47:18,240 --> 01:47:20,170
I have brought peace...

1035
01:47:20,270 --> 01:47:21,970
freedom, justice...

1036
01:47:22,070 --> 01:47:25,910
and security to my new empire.

1037
01:47:26,010 --> 01:47:28,880
Your new empire?

1038
01:47:28,980 --> 01:47:32,310
Don't make me kill you.

1039
01:47:32,420 --> 01:47:36,910
Anakin, my allegiance
is to the Republic, to democracy!

1040
01:47:37,020 --> 01:47:39,620
If you're not with me...

1041
01:47:40,660 --> 01:47:42,560
then you're my enemy.

1042
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:47,050
Only a Sith deals in absolutes.

1043
01:47:49,670 --> 01:47:52,070
I will do what I must.

1044
01:47:52,170 --> 01:47:54,570
You will try.

1045
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:30,360
I hear a new apprentice you have, Emperor.

1046
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:34,940
Or should I call you Darth Sidious?

1047
01:48:35,050 --> 01:48:37,280
Master Yoda.

1048
01:48:37,380 --> 01:48:39,440
You survived.

1049
01:48:39,550 --> 01:48:42,280
Surprised?

1050
01:48:42,390 --> 01:48:46,980
Your arrogance blinds you, Master Yoda.

1051
01:48:47,090 --> 01:48:49,150
Now you will experience...

1052
01:48:49,260 --> 01:48:53,720
the full power of the dark side.

1053
01:49:35,670 --> 01:49:39,370
I have waited a long time...

1054
01:49:39,480 --> 01:49:42,040
for this moment...

1055
01:49:42,150 --> 01:49:46,670
my little green friend.

1056
01:49:55,730 --> 01:50:00,360
At last the Jedi are no more.

1057
01:50:00,470 --> 01:50:04,700
Not if anything to say about it I have.

1058
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,130
Aah!

1059
01:50:09,310 --> 01:50:12,370
At an end your rule is.

1060
01:50:14,250 --> 01:50:16,680
And not short enough it was.

1061
01:50:20,620 --> 01:50:23,640
If so powerful you are...

1062
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:27,220
why leave?

1063
01:50:27,330 --> 01:50:29,890
You will not stop me.

1064
01:50:29,990 --> 01:50:34,590
Darth Vader will become
more powerful than either of us.

1065
01:50:34,700 --> 01:50:39,070
Faith in your new apprentice
misplaced may be.

1066
01:50:40,370 --> 01:50:44,430
As is your faith
in the dark side of the Force.

1067
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:14,810
Hurry. Careful timing we will need.

1068
01:55:14,910 --> 01:55:17,710
Activate your homing beacon
when you're ready.

1069
01:55:17,820 --> 01:55:20,180
There's no sign of his body, sir.

1070
01:55:20,280 --> 01:55:23,950
- Then he is not dead.
- Double your search.

1071
01:55:24,060 --> 01:55:26,290
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

1072
01:55:26,390 --> 01:55:31,490
Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle
for immediate takeoff.

1073
01:55:31,600 --> 01:55:36,660
- Yes, Master.
- I sense Lord Vader is in danger.

1074
01:56:45,500 --> 01:56:49,270
Into exile I must go.

1075
01:56:49,370 --> 01:56:51,470
Failed I have.

1076
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:32,840
I have failed you, Anakin.

1077
01:58:32,940 --> 01:58:34,840
I have failed you.

1078
01:58:34,950 --> 01:58:37,850
I should have known the Jedi
were plotting to take over.

1079
01:58:37,950 --> 01:58:40,750
Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil!

1080
01:58:40,850 --> 01:58:43,510
From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.

1081
01:58:43,620 --> 01:58:45,180
Well, then you are lost!

1082
01:58:57,070 --> 01:58:59,590
This is the end for you, my master.

1083
01:59:24,130 --> 01:59:28,220
It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground.

1084
01:59:29,900 --> 01:59:32,600
You underestimate my power.

1085
01:59:32,700 --> 01:59:35,070
Don't try it.

1086
01:59:57,160 --> 01:59:59,930
You were the chosen one!

1087
02:00:01,430 --> 02:00:04,630
It was said that you would
destroy the Sith, not join them!

1088
02:00:07,270 --> 02:00:09,330
Bring balance to the Force...

1089
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:11,970
not leave it in darkness!

1090
02:00:22,750 --> 02:00:25,090
I hate you!

1091
02:00:32,530 --> 02:00:34,790
You were my brother, Anakin.

1092
02:00:36,870 --> 02:00:39,200
I loved you.

1093
02:01:19,080 --> 02:01:21,040
Oh. Master Kenobi.

1094
02:01:21,150 --> 02:01:23,410
Um, we have Miss Padme on board.

1095
02:01:23,510 --> 02:01:26,040
Yes. Please, please hurry.

1096
02:01:26,150 --> 02:01:28,310
We should leave this dreadful place.

1097
02:01:40,360 --> 02:01:42,330
Obi-Wan.

1098
02:01:43,870 --> 02:01:46,060
Is Anakin all right?

1099
02:02:54,670 --> 02:02:57,470
Your Majesty, this way.

1100
02:02:57,570 --> 02:02:59,470
There he is.

1101
02:02:59,580 --> 02:03:01,740
He's still alive.

1102
02:03:04,750 --> 02:03:06,980
Get a medical capsule immediately.

1103
02:03:07,080 --> 02:03:09,050
Yes, sir. Right away.

1104
02:03:44,250 --> 02:03:46,950
Excuse me, Master Yoda.

1105
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:55,060
Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact.

1106
02:04:11,920 --> 02:04:14,320
We'll take her to the medical center.
Quickly.

1107
02:04:43,880 --> 02:04:46,870
Medically, she's completely healthy.

1108
02:04:46,980 --> 02:04:50,180
For reasons we can't explain,
we are losing her.

1109
02:04:51,560 --> 02:04:54,290
- She's dying?
- We don't know why.

1110
02:04:54,390 --> 02:04:56,450
She has lost the will to live.

1111
02:04:56,560 --> 02:04:59,720
We need to operate quickly
if we are to save the babies.

1112
02:04:59,830 --> 02:05:01,420
Babies?

1113
02:05:01,530 --> 02:05:03,400
She's carrying twins.

1114
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:45,470
Ee-see-tah oy-doh.

1115
02:05:45,580 --> 02:05:48,340
Luke.

1116
02:05:55,250 --> 02:05:58,780
Oh, Luke.

1117
02:06:02,360 --> 02:06:06,630
Ooh-bah, ooh-bah.

1118
02:06:16,140 --> 02:06:19,110
Ee-see-tah oy-dah.

1119
02:06:19,210 --> 02:06:22,140
- It's a girl.
- Leia.

1120
02:07:04,120 --> 02:07:06,750
Obi-Wan?

1121
02:07:10,990 --> 02:07:12,890
There's good in him.

1122
02:07:15,600 --> 02:07:17,530
I know.

1123
02:07:17,630 --> 02:07:20,230
I know there's...

1124
02:07:20,340 --> 02:07:22,310
still...

1125
02:07:56,510 --> 02:07:59,200
Lord Vader.

1126
02:07:59,310 --> 02:08:01,400
Can you hear me?

1127
02:08:04,450 --> 02:08:06,920
Yes, Master.

1128
02:08:09,050 --> 02:08:11,890
Where is Padme?

1129
02:08:11,990 --> 02:08:14,650
Is she safe?

1130
02:08:15,760 --> 02:08:17,750
Is she all right?

1131
02:08:19,500 --> 02:08:24,020
It seems, in your anger, you killed her.

1132
02:08:25,070 --> 02:08:27,970
I? I couldn't have.

1133
02:08:28,070 --> 02:08:31,060
She was alive. I felt it!

1134
02:08:50,860 --> 02:08:55,160
No!

1135
02:09:05,040 --> 02:09:09,670
Hidden, safe the children must be kept.

1136
02:09:09,780 --> 02:09:14,010
We must take them somewhere where
the Sith will not sense their presence.

1137
02:09:15,120 --> 02:09:19,050
Hmm. Split up they should be.

1138
02:09:19,160 --> 02:09:21,280
My wife and I will take the girl.

1139
02:09:22,860 --> 02:09:25,790
We've always talked
of adopting a baby girl.

1140
02:09:25,900 --> 02:09:28,130
She will be loved with us.

1141
02:09:28,230 --> 02:09:31,030
And what of the boy?

1142
02:09:31,130 --> 02:09:35,470
To Tatooine. To his family send him.

1143
02:09:37,310 --> 02:09:39,740
I will take the child and watch over him.

1144
02:09:44,450 --> 02:09:48,890
Until the time is right,
disappear we will.

1145
02:09:50,690 --> 02:09:54,280
Master Kenobi, wait a moment.

1146
02:09:55,830 --> 02:10:01,030
In your solitude on Tatooine,
training I have for you.

1147
02:10:01,130 --> 02:10:03,690
Training?

1148
02:10:03,800 --> 02:10:08,360
An old friend has learned
the path to immortality.

1149
02:10:10,440 --> 02:10:13,530
One who has returned from
the netherworld of the Force.

1150
02:10:13,640 --> 02:10:16,130
Your old master.

1151
02:10:16,250 --> 02:10:18,240
Qui-Gon?

1152
02:10:20,750 --> 02:10:24,020
How to commune with him I will teach you.

1153
02:10:25,520 --> 02:10:27,680
- Captain Antilles.
- Yes, Your Highness?

1154
02:10:27,790 --> 02:10:29,690
I'm placing these droids in your care.

1155
02:10:29,790 --> 02:10:31,690
Treat them well. Clean them up.

1156
02:10:31,800 --> 02:10:33,700
Have the protocol droid's mind wiped.

1157
02:10:33,800 --> 02:10:35,260
What?

1158
02:10:37,130 --> 02:10:39,100
Oh, no.
